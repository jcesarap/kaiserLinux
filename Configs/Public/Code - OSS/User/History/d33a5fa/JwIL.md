> Mth's Practagraphy - Don't shorthand Mth. Basic mistakes happen all too often - make them too obvious to happen, by using more paper, more ink, more steps.

- Focus
    - Vegemor, Timers (as mind is silenced from fear of losing itself) - are principles of Steel applied here.
    - Uza Paves focus.
    - *The key to music practise is having music printed in good sized paper, in comfortable places near the instruments*.

- Eht Language Learning
    - **Mnemonics** to syntax - that's how you memorise any amount of things
    - Have the above **embedded in code as comments**.
      - That's how you learn - not theory notes, but **Paced Yielding Learning, Paced by constant practise and direct immersion (aided by indexes)**.
    - **Simplify new terms into simpler/parallel ones** - see **equal attjori** of different given names (E.g., Arguments = Parameters; Hooks ≈ APIs).
- Dreads - What you'll do hence forth, as documented on `Braiding.md`.

> Want Mac? Install Gnome on Arch (no multiple monitors here, it will always suck and require wacom config, which will also suck) - a lot better, actually usable.
> Eht? Use multiple monitors. Studying? Single monitor is better, combined with Pace-logging side tasks, focusing on only one thing at a time.

# Last Days of Recess
# Gaming with Iank
> Portal, Minecraft, Free Fire; Download `XOutput` to have shitty controllers be recognised - keep Windows for later testing of Flows on Windows, as Windows VMs don't run well.
> Now you have college, a girlfriend, and study what you love, you can keep possible distractions near - you can fully control yourself. You have proven such in the last few months with Overwatch installed and forgotten about it.

# College Schedule
