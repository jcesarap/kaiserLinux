> Mth's Practagraphy - Don't shorthand Mth. Basic mistakes happen all too often - make them too obvious to happen, by using more paper, more ink, more steps.

- Focus
    - Vegemor, Timers (as mind is silenced from fear of losing itself) - are principles of Steel applied here.
    - Uza Paves focus.
    - *The key to music practise is having music printed in good sized paper, in comfortable places near the instruments*.

> Learn to Pace, discard and prioritise time and investments in learning while on the recess also - FIND SIMPLICITY / 儉无为.
> Flows & unamed_network_parent_control are Paced due to complexity. Flows tends to be a better fit for CV, dismissing the other as priority is now getting Lifrin, as it's enough for Freifringa without the great risk of no Yield.

- 2 days of dedicated programming (and Designing Iank's Game)
- 7 days of Mth (with programming after)

# Quick

> Freedom is achieved by morphography. There are different IDEs with great features, so...

- Retrieve basic nvim - and keep it basic.
- Adapt VSCode config to be compatible with nvim (with launcher evoked with Ctrl+G as well).
  - Disable stuff that isn't available on nvim.
  - Backup vscode config
- `Make reminder →` Other features are handled by file explorers, terminals, git - this is how you achieve independence and agnostic extensible.
  - → As in the future you'll have changing needs, and to keep maintaining nvim isn't wise (wait for improvements to it and for someone else pay the price for the logic and time spent Yieldlessly).

> Yesterday was stressful. **You can play after finishing, or watch a movie - and then temporarily skip right to programming (resuming usual college chores tomorrow)**.

# Braids

- **Research Twists** → Re-do them in 6x6 (more on the front) - the sections will later be used for dreads

# Notes-to-organise
> This counts as a table item study.
- "Or" - What does it mean in set language? How to solve other problems.
- Reinforce notes on 1st degree equations and finding their roots (through mnemonics)
- Move
    - `Sketch.md`
        - PCALC - Notes on Limits
            - `Take note (In Calculus, Unit I) →` Notes & Snippets - Forget about Latex in Litill. Too complicated. Notes on paper/markdown will do, as the main thing is observing the flow and extracting the algorithms - and not just capturing every detail of a calculation
        - IEE - Notes on homework (**LEAVE UNCONDENSED**)
        - EHT - Unify C notes (while keeping algorithms separate)
        - All - Integrate all notes of previous semestre
        - All - Do college Eisenhoweri -
            - With subjects for the semestre
            - Split subject files with proper subjects inside each unit - that's how you'll do the eisenhower
            - Add Reminder: Following extension programs could be teaching PCALC.

# Later

> Side note reminder → Experiment/Submerge directly in/with Kotlin (a simple app is the best way to learn - same applies for React/React Native). Go one step / research at a time - same as you did with Bash.

- Learn motorbiking
- Monthversary
    - Buy rose
    - Finish writing thing on Sketch-Litill

# Last Days of Recess

- Games
    - Rocket League (Epic Game Launcher)
    - It Takes Two (Fit girl / Lutris)
    - ###### Minecraft (Prism Launcher) (It's currently working on Arch anyway)
- Setup script on "secsulruna" (secondary Dropbox account)
- Iank's Desk - With old desk of yours from time in Syv-2.

## Roots
- Done on Windows - keep the OS for later testing of Flows for Windows (Windows VMs don't run well enough).
- f2 for bios settings - f12 for boot select
- Now you have college, a girlfriend, and study what you love, you can keep possible distractions near - you can fully control yourself. You have proven such in the last few months with Overwatch installed and forgotten about it.
