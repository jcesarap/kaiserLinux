# Reminders
- Don't ever go to college on foot again - you get ever sweatier than by bike, takes longer, and equally sunny as it's mid-day

# Að Tala - Pace Relevance
# Versai
> "All his life has he looked away…to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing." 
- Enjoy each step. The perfection of each Pace is how it leads you further.
- To advance something beyond friendship is beyond your control, reliant on opportunity - which upon sudden rises not fear to act.

# Forewords
> Definitions on how to act on doubts and key aspects of a relationship.
- Temporarily kept here due to its importance in current Pace.
- 儉无为 should apply here as anywhere else, note taken only on the most Yielding aspects.

# General
- Leave - Message when you're going away and becoming busy, so she knows your delay is not of unconcern - because you would enjoy the same treatment.
- Morning - Answer but her, before getting immediately up, only getting back once you've showered and eaten - ready to sit down and focus.
- Time - As ye grow together, ye'll also grow apart. More time you'll have to yourself, from more security she will feel, less longing, yet deeper love - you'll be further able to explore your art and yourself, yet having her as your safehaven, and you hers.

# þråenr
- To have someone is to silence feelings of unedequacy - to Steel unto the path. There may be a cost, but there's also a sparing - of pain and liebegaldrari. To endure life here, you'll need to become human.
- O'Strøm 'Iank unless Alvorada - when there's enough mastery in uza to reach the sun. Until then, heal and be healed
- Liebe - You're new at it. In time you'll master it and your mind undsearch er its state. Through Bindings, Attjori and Sattjori such as warning her you'll be busy - to be okay with leaving her.
- On shame - If things don't work out, and someone makes fun of you for that (falling for someone loving, trustworthy and with no red flags), is just them showing to be shit - not that you were a fool. þråenr, $user_name's got great grades on Enem; Sattjor, if she moves back to her town, you've got enough money to travel there two weekends per month, as she's open about splitting bills.

# Safn
> $user_name Evelly dos Santos Villar
- 14 of October you began taking the same classes in college.
- 12 of November you talked for the first time on runes.
- 21 of November stuff began to unravel as she grew fond of you by the joke of talking to yourself.
- 25 of November she furthered it, trying to decypher your profile picture with reference/joke to jomo (playfulness on jomo, but joy of losing out, with background of Ted Kaczisnky).
- 28 of November she began sending you tiktok videos.
- 07 of December you had your first date.

# Fore Moving Að Tala Highlights
- Unreciprocity / Expression - One who speaks a lot, not necessarily wants to hear a lot, or talk a lot, and leaving them with silence when they are not speaking otherwise, may be the treatment they seek.

# On Facing almost certain reproval
> https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/15q5fns/reprovar_na_faculdade_afeta_a_carreira_acad%C3%AAmica/?rdt=45172
- Pra algumas coisas afeta sim. Alguns programas que dão bolsas exigem CRE acima de 7, outros que o aluno não tenha mais de **2 reprovações**, coisas assim..
- Demorei 8 anos para formar em engenharia. Fiz mestrado, histórico escolar não era um critério de seleção, depois fiz doutorado e hoje trabalho na área do meu mestrado/doutorado. 

# Next Braids at Home
- Twice you did them with a dude who blatently ignored your requests, binding you to months with a fucked up style.
- Next time you'll do it on your own.
- Spending half the money on good mirrors
- Doing it at home, cheaper, next time for free
- Exactly how you want it - with the security you'll be learning, and no longer have to rely on someone else, or big deposits
- At the time that is most convinient to you
- At the rush you need, at the time most comfortable
- Watching or listening to something, or studying, instead of having to make conversation.
- Also, this time it should last more than 2 months.

# Runaglyphi
- Send Keepass to Sketchpad on Linux - while Android can be closed as it has a fingerprint scanner.
- Nvim's tab opens directory - or image of the currently selected line, for edditing
- Raðasamanbøk is dismissed, as fzf and algorithms fulfill that simpler, as well as nvim and `r-<name>.md` files.
- `/` in feh fits to screen

Section: Iank  Crisis
---

# þråenr
- Iank seemed to be running away from you, from kissing you, yesterday.
- You pondered if she sees you merely as a "male" friend, but as she doesn't have any, mistakes you for a boyfriend.
- ...
- You forget her grandmother may be dying, so she may be like that temporarily.
- Be willing to be wrong and to be that for now, otherwise you'll be worse, even if you're right.

# Sattjor
- Retirement will come only after college... You'll have the strength to do what is necessary then, if such is needed...
- Thay, Lua, Cec.

# Ny Dynamics
- Tell her what you need doing - the pressure from her knowing may even push you.
- Promise - yourself and her - that you'll properly talk later (at night).
## Sattjor
- You fear it may break the relationship, but spending all day with her tallking is already pushing you...
- So take the risk, over the certain distaste of not doing what you need.

Section: þérsorav

> You don't have the resources to do otherwise, to bulk now, so properly shred - allowing a proper bulking without a shit pouch.

- Bulking Phase - Properly after lifrina and shreding  - don't worry.
- Shreding Phase - Current Year.
    - Avi - A monk, a warrior... eat but the plain needed, simple, and resume focus...
        - ...Any other desire is an indication of unfocus - just as anger indicates unbalance.
        - Beware of them as tradeoffs - no longer excuse yourself of Wiezenie having bought them.
        - Avi - Pace (they're only allowed after shredding, then, before þérsorav).

> Your face gets moisty and dirty, your hair also with fat and skin-excrement. Avoid fatty and sweets, to avoid shaving your head.

Section: X

- Contact Paradox - Little movement may feel like more movement, as more is kept in touch instead of removed.
- Queried Experimentation - Try it out, ask her about it also.
- Bigger Muscle Focus - Use Glutes instead of abdomen - for thrusts.
- First Time (Muscle being used )
    - Pain - Shouldn't hurt, as long as principles are obeyed. Stop when it hurts.
    - Hydro - Lots of foreplay
    - Pace (Speed) - Slow and gentle first 5-10 times
    - Pace (Magnitude) - Oral and fingers first

---

- Try super short braids (eye brown height - sligthly more as hair is already that long) - long enough only to be moved left and tied by two bigger ones.
- You can use the other hair in case this doesn't look good - and you'll be redoing it anyway.
