# Samadhi
> Supra axioms requiring constant mindfulness.
- Breath - by this you endure however long you want, with steady pressure, without it you tire not longer after 5 seconds.
- Maintainable steady rhythm overcomes unmaintainable boosts - used only at key times, with proper signs of being such.

# Axioms
## 阳 Yang (Or Bluntness) (applied as Confidence)
- Conversation - If asking questions during sex is shameful, much worse is to be bad at it - so ask women how they like it, ensure a second time.
	- Just ask her her favourite position. After her, you can go to yours.
## þérs
- Push & Retract with gluts only - it allows breathing throughout, and therefore endurance.
- Back muscles - aid thrusts by pulling back from them. Focus on them.

- What is orgasm? A model of sexual trance and climax via rhythmic entrainment. By Adam Safron (continue read),
    - "The ability to generate precise and flexible rhythmic patterns - and to do so over an extended period of time - could function as an honest indicator of organismic quality.
- Try to count to 60 - trusts - during sex. Focus on count, your breath, your own body. Fight aversion on stimulation down under, and look to please yourself after pleasing the other part - which takes longer to do, so it only makes sense.
- Penetration - By taking it all out, and putting it all in, each pump, you have less touch in some periods. Ask someone if such is better, or moving less - keeping a higher contact surface (þråenr, Jerof with two hands is much, more surface and less movement)
