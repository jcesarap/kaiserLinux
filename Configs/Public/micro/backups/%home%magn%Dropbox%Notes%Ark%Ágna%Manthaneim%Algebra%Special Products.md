# Definitions
- Formulas/patterns that arise when raising expressions to n power.
- However, to try to memorise them is un-Yielding, specially in current Pace.

# Formula Dynamics
> E.g., (a+b)³  =  a³ + 3*a²*b + 3*a*b² + b³
- Inference - Upon forgetting the formula. Apply the Distributive Property of Multiplication, and they can all be infered - as to raise an expression to n power, equals to multiplying it by itself n times
## Exponents
- Borders - At the borders they're equal to outside the parenthesis.
- Centre - Each operation closer, they go down by one.
- Multiplication - The multiplication at centre operations is equal to the power the expression is raised to. 
- Reference - The exponent applies in relation to its element...
> I.e., if to the border next, b³, then to the centre, b².
## Signs
> E.g., (x+3)(x-3) = x² - 9
- Strømrav
	- Operation Sign - Signs between numbers - not explicitly linked to any.
	- Value Sign - Signs explicitly linked to numbers - or the positive value, which is implied.
- Operation Signs are operated as Value Signs (only) in Distributive Multiplication.
- In Formula - To be consistent with the above, When applying numbers to formulas, apply only the Value-Signs and not the Operations-Signs between.
> In Formula Example (3y should not be -3y in the formula, as that's an operation sign) - (2x²-3y)² = (2x²)² - 2 * 2x² * 3y + (3y)²
## Difference
- Mixed (sum and subtraction)
	- (a+b)*(a-b) = a² - b²
- Squared - Minus at 2ab
	- When it's: (a+b)(a-b), just square each.
- Cubic - Minus at the borders
	- a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

# Misc
## Exponents in Variables
- They can still be raised to the power
- You raise the coefficient and exponent - of the variable.
	- Effectively increasing the coefficient while keeping the exponent on the variable - unspent.
## Inter-Variable multiplication
> E.g., (2x²-3y)² = (2x²)² - 2 * 2x² * 3y + (3y)²
- To multiply multiple variables together, multiply coefficients, and joint them.

# Alternative Method
> If you forget any formulas, you can do Distributive Multiplication, henceforth described.
- Say you have (x+y)³.
- Multiply the first with the second.
- Multiply the result of the above, with the third.
- Continue moving on, if you have a higher exponent.
> In short, do two at a time - as anywhere else.

# Factoring Expressions
## Decompose
> Terms into pieces.
- Exponents into multiplications.
- Factorisation.
	- E.g., 6 = 2*3 (its prime factors)
- Coefficients (factored), variables and constants.
## Common Ground Highlighting
> What separates terms is sum and subtraction - which, opposed to multiplication/division, doesn't couple with variables.
- Whatever is in all terms, you factor out of parenthesis.
## Cross
- Removing what was highlighted, you get what will get into the parenthesis.

# Example 1
> x² + 3x
## Decompose
- x * x + 3 * x
## Common Ground Highlighting
- X is in all terms
## Cross
> ~~x~~ * x + 3 * ~~x~~
- x*(x+3)

# Example 2
> 6x²-4x
## Decompose
- Factor 6 into 2*3
- 6x² = 2 * 3 * x * x - 2 * 2 * x
## Common Ground Highlighting
> Terms are split by sum and subtraction.
- Term 1 - 2, x
- Term 2 - 2, x repeat
## Cross
> Since 2x repeat, they get out, what remains is in the parenthesis.
- 2x(3*x-2)



> Writing an algebraic expression as a product - rooted in a fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics, that any whole number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers.
## General rules
- Can't couple different terms, even if they have common particles.
    - E.g., xy + y = y (x+1)
        - Can't do a thing here.
- Can't sum different exponents
    - E.g., 1xy + x² = xy (1+x) 
- Sign Play
    - E.g., 3x - 2y
        - x's coeffficient = 3
        - y's coefficient = -2
## Process
> Special Products are reversed.
- Factor Coefficients.
- Sunder Coefficients - Split Coefficients and Constants - for Factoring Quadratics.
- Factor Quadratics
    - If an X multiplies another, it turns into x²
    - So 8x turns into 8(x).
- Parenthesis Multiplication
    - Is how the factoring works.
- Sign
    - Negative GCFs are factored as negative.
## Example
- Input - 2x² + 8x
- Factor Coefficients - 2 and 8 are multiples of 2.
- Sunder Coefficients - Split Coefficients from Constants, to avoid unintended Quadratics.
- Factor Quadratics - 2x times x equals x²
- Parenthesis Multiplication = 2x (x + 4)
