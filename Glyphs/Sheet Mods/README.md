# Forewords

> Musescore, by default, already has a plugin that shows note names.

- ## 10-20 (when you're 40) years of practice will learn you the notes without mods - not that that matters.

# How to use/install
> Side note: You can only use it with interactive documents. To transcribe/convert scanned documents into interactive files, Musescore recommends Audiveris.

1. Right click on first bar line.
1. Stave/part properties.
1. Advanced style properties.
1. Note head scheme: Pitch names.
1. Plugins.
1. **Octave**.

# Roadmap

## Guitar

> 

- In Tablature, adding note names (maybe it already works).
- In Sheets, use the default.
- Couple both notation systems into one file.

# Pivotting - Before you knew Musescore already had it

> Here just so I remember the thought process, and don't try this again.

- At first I developed a simpler notation system, but quickly realised that coding/automating conversion would be too complicated, and the simplicity removed the ability to work with orchestras - so I thought about adding similar complexity, but what would be the point? Too much work, for no reward.
- So the idea evolved to remove the aspect of most friction of thought, the most poorly designed aspect, so you can learn standard sight-reading naturally, with a lot of time, but comfortable practise.

> I didn't want to be like [Dvorak](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dvorak_keyboard_layout). Developing a new standard would be a lot of work, it wouldn't replace the old, nor pay off in any way - even if it was more efficient, it wouldn't be for those who already mastered the old.
